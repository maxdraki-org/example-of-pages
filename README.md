# This is an example Insights 'Page'

## Why do we have Pages?
'Pages' allow Insights to be grouped together for a particular purpose - for example to group all Insights that related to **mobile** that might otherwise be spread across many different Analytics and Data Science Teams

For example this lists all Inights with the tag `example` and displays them as cards
::insights{query="#example" layout=square sortField=name sortDirection=asc}

This is a specific insight
